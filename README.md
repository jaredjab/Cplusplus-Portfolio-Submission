# Cplusplus-Portfolio-Submission

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    The project was to make a program that would read cities and temperatures in fahrenheit from a .txt file
    and convert the temperatures to celsius. Then create or update a file with the cities and their new celsius temperatures.
  
- What did you do particularly well?
    I think I did a good job of keeping the code concise. It is a simple program that doesn't have any extraneous or redundant code.

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I could have added a comment for the main function describing the functionality of the program as well as an author comment.
  
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? 
    Understanding that the input and output streams were their own objects was a good thing to learn with this project.
    The syntax of using ifstream and ofstream confused me at first because I had only ever used cin and cout until this point.
  
- What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    Github for a start. I also have used AI to explain certain concepts in a way that will make me understand how and why they work.
    I also have multiple family members and friends in the industry that are very helpful when it comes to coding help.

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    Using input and output file streams will be endlessly useful for storing data for programs, especially over time / between instances of the program.
    The inventory managment program I am working on now uses file streams for this purpose.

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I kept the formatting consistent, used descriptive yet concise variable names, and made use of comments to explain the function of every section of code.
